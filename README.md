This concept outlines a bot designed to run initially on Telegram (ideal for an MVP) with plans to expand to WhatsApp in the future. The core idea is to move beyond mere task management into a realm of genuine social intelligence.

## The Product Core

The fundamental utility of the bot revolves around helping the user manage their obligations and social calendar, ensuring that important dates and connections are never overlooked.

- **Standard Reminders**: The bot provides classic reminder functionalities for tasks (to-dos), birthdays, anniversaries, and other significant dates.

**The Emotional Intelligence Layer (Contact Reminders)**

This is where the bot differentiates itself, adding a valuable layer of emotional intelligence to the user's social life.

- **Relationship Nurturing Reminders:** The bot monitors the user's interaction cadence with key contacts and prompts them to maintain those relationships.

- - Example: "Hey, it's been 15 days since you last talked to Anna." (Feature to be implemented / **To be developed**)
